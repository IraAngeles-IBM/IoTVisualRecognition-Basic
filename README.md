# IoT Fire Alarm using Node-RED and IBM Visual Recognition 

This project is a how-to guide on using Node-RED and IBM Visual Recognition service to analyse an image and based on a trigger word then send a event command to IoT Device. In this example node-red is used to create an image upload form which sends the image to IBM Visual Recognition and trigger an iot device whenever fire is detected in the image.
